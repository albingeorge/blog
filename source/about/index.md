I'm Albin George.

I'm always on the lookout to learn something new, but I believe I'm the laziest person alive. To make things worse, I'm also a procrastinator.

Oh wait, there's more. I'm a hardcore gamer. Until recently, I used to spent atleast 4 hours a day on games(mostly [Dota](http://blog.dota2.com/)).

Anyways, this blog is my attempt to keep track of(and improve) my life.
